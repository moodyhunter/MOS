 * @brief Allocate/free the physical memory.
 *
 * @details
 * The physical memory manager is responsible for allocating and freeing physical memory.
 *
 * PMM is initialized by the (probably) early architecture-specific code, where it calls
 * \ref pmm_add_region_bytes to add the physical memory information provided by the bootloader.
 *
 * After enough (typically all) physical memory has been added, \ref pmm_allocate_frames can be
 * called to allocate physical memory.
 *
 * @note The allocated physical memory is not zeroed out, in fact, it does nothing to the real memory.
