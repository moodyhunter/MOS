# MOS Configuration

MOS is highly configurable, and you can configure it both at compile time and runtime.

- [Kconfig Configuration System](kconfig.md): Configure the kernel using the Kconfig configuration system.
- [Kernel Command Line](cmdline.md): Configure the kernel at runtime using the kernel command line.
